    With the objective of measuring efficiency through Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), this study aims to evaluate the quantitative trainees by department of the University of Brasília in a given period. In order to represent and calculate departmental efficiency in the training of graduates and post graduates at the University. Such work will demonstrate efficiency and seek to represent the capacity of departments in the academic training of their students. The data will be extracted from institutional systems of the University of Brasília, appropriating fifteen (15) departments that will be defined as decision making units (DMU), making efficiency comparison possible and demonstrating information for analysis.
    However, the modeling will be composed of inputs and outputs that will serve as inputs to the presented analysis model, which in turn will bring a representation of the efficiency model for observation
